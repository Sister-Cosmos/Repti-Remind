# ReptiRemind
## What is Repit-Remind?
Repti-Remind is a "pet care app" that i have developed to keep track of important information and dates for your pets. While Repti-Remind is a reptile based application, that doesn't render it usless when
it comes to cats, dogs and other pets of the like.
### The core features in Repti=Remind
- Reminder page: the home page where you can create reminders for important dates and events.
- Pet Page: this page will host all pet information allowing you to quickly find information about your pet. (P.S. this was designed for reptile "Hobbyists")
## How to install
After downloading the project, make sure that you run "npm install" into your console to download the pakages needed, if further issues arise try "npx expo intall".
## How to use Repti-Remind
### steps:
  1. Open the project in your perferred editor/workspace, i persoanlly use VSC.
  2. when the project is open, make sure to open two terminals, one terminal will work as your backend while the other as your frontend.
  3. Start your backend in one of the terminals run these commands "cd server", "npm start". this will start the backend.
  4. Start your frontend in the other terminal, you will not need to change directories for this as long as you're already in the project. run this command "npx expo start". (do note that i am having some bugs that cause the app to crash on launch, just try it 2-3 times before resulting to trubleshooting.
